[Notes]
- massive instance referencing error with the music. Solved problem by rewriting the script for AudioManager. The toggle function is separate in MusicToggle.cs, directly referencing "BGM" with FindObjectOfType<AudioManager>().Play("BGM") or .Pause("BGM").
- PlayerPref "isSave" is reset to 0 when applying settings in option, and starting the game via the name entry screen.
- Load Game button does not work if currLives PlayerPref is 0.
